#Conclusion
When comparing the conditional group with the unconditional group we found, through a Fisher Exact Test a significant p-value of 0.048. This means that an unconditional incentive leads to a higher response rate than a conditional incentive in a one-shot way. Moreover we found that even if people did not want to have the 50 eurocents they still wanted to fill in the survey. This could be explained by the way of positive reciprocity [Gneezy & Rey-Biel (2014)](http://pareto.uab.es/prey/jeea.12062.pdf). However our experiment is conducted in a one-shot way. When firms are willing to inform or obtain information from customers or citizens multiple times the outcomes could be different. [Caustiglioni & Pforr (2008)](https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/view/599/2137) found that conditional incentives are more effective in increasing response rates than unconditional incentives in panel data. So in the end it would be optimal for firms to use conditional incentives when they use surveys based on panel data and unconditional incentives when they use surveys based on a one-shot way. 

When comparing the small certain payments with the large uncertain payments we found no statistically significantly difference in response rates. This could be explained by the fact that our rewards are very small and that people are not affected in a significant way. However we do find a difference in response rates for women. This can be explained by the fact that women are more risk averse [Dohmen et al (2005)](http://ftp.iza.org/dp1730.pdf). Moreover we did not found evidence that people overestimate small chances. This means that offering respondents a small chance of getting an incentive does not seem very effective. We recommend that firms should use small certain payments instead of large uncertain payments because people tend to be more risk-averse. However this will depend on the chance of receiving a uncertain payment because the higher the chance the lower the risk-aversiness will be. 

From the literature we saw that offering an incentive is always better than not offering an incentive and that offering a monetary incentive is more effective than offering a non-monetary incentive [Singer et al (1999)](http://www.jos.nu/Articles/article.asp). In our experiment we did not found a significant difference between a monetary incentive and a non-monetary incentive but we would recommend firms to use monetary incentives based on the literature we found. Furthermore the higher the reward the higher the response rate since their is a linear relationship between these two [Yu & Cooper 1983](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3151410.pdf).
