#Conclusion
When comparing the conditional group with the unconditional group we found, through a Fisher Exact Test a significant p-value of 0.048. This means that an unconditional incentive leads to a higher response rate than a conditional incentive in a one-shot way. Moreover we found that even if people did not want to have the 50 eurocents they still wanted to fill in the survey. This could be explained by the way of positive reciprocity [Gneezy & Rey-Biel (2014)](http://pareto.uab.es/prey/jeea.12062.pdf). Respondents of the conditional group exerted more effort than the respondents in the unconditional group in our experiment. However our experiment is conducted in a one-shot way. When firms are willing to inform or obtain information from customers or citizens multiple times the outcomes could be different. [Caustiglioni & Pforr (2008)](https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/view/599/2137) found that conditional incentives are more effective in increasing response rates than unconditional incentives in panel data. So in the end it would be optimal for firms to use conditional incentives when they use surveys based on panel data and unconditional incentives when they use surveys based on a one-shot way. 

When comparing the small certain payments with the large uncertain payments we found no statistically significantly difference in response rates. This could be explained by the fact that our rewards are very small and that people are not affected in a significant way. However we do find a difference in response rates for women. This can be explained by the fact that women are more risk averse [Dohmen et al (2005)](http://ftp.iza.org/dp1730.pdf). Moreover we did not found evidence that people overestimate small chances. This means that offering respondents a small chance of getting an incentive does not seem very effective. We recommend that firms should use small certain payments instead of large uncertain payments because people tend to be more risk-averse. However this will depend on the chance of receiving a uncertain payment because the higher the chance the lower the risk-aversiness will be. 

From the literature we saw that offering an incentive is always better than not offering an incentive and that offering a monetary incentive is more effective than offering a non-monetary incentive [Singer et al (1999)](http://www.jos.nu/Articles/article.asp). In our experiment we did not found a significant difference between a monetary incentive and a non-monetary incentive but we would recommend firms to use monetary incentives based on the literature we found. Furthermore the higher the reward the higher the response rate since their is a linear relationship between these two [Yu & Cooper 1983](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3151410.pdf).   

Firstly a limitation of our experiment is that it is conducted in a one-shot way and not (also) as panel data. However their is sufficient literature on panel data on conditional incentives and unconditional incentives comparisons. Unfortunately this is not the case for the small certain payment and large uncertain payment comparison. Therefore there is more literature needed because results could be different for panel data and our experiment only was conducted in a one-shot way.

Secondly the value of our incentives are low so results could be different when these are higher. According to the literature the higher the value of the incentive the higher the response rate will be. In case of the conditional and unconditional incentive this could mean that the potential increase in response rate in the conditional group outweighs the potential increase in the unconditional group. In the small certain payments and large uncertain payments the difference could potentially increase because the higher the uncertain payment and the higher the certain payments people would choose the 'safe' option more than the 'unsafe option' because of their risk-aversiness.

Last of all increasing the number of respondents and including people who are not a student could potentially change the results. 

#Answer
We found a significant p-value of 0.04798 when comparing conditional and unconditional incentives, so this means that unconditional incentives are more effective in increasing response rates than conditional incentives. Comparing the effort between the conditional and unconditional incentive groups we found a significant p-value of 0.004, so people exert more effort in the conditional group than the unconditional group. Comparing the effort exerted on average between men and women we found a p-value of 0.0003 trough the Mann-Whitney U test. This indicates that women exert more effort on average than men. Comparing between the small certain payment group and the large uncertain payment group on effort levels we found an insignificant p-value of 0.226 which indicates that there is no significant difference in effort exerted between these two groups. The Fisher Exact Test we ran on whether the response rate differs between a small certain payment and a large uncertain payment gave us a p-value of 0.38. Therefore there is no significant difference between these two groups in response rates. The Fisher Exact Test we ran on whether the response rates differes between a small certain payment and a large uncertain payment only for women gave us a p-value of 0.04976. This means that women are significantly more affected by a small certain payment than a large uncertain payment.  

#Assumptions
* There are no significant differences between the groups' characteristics
* There is no interviewer bias since the same interviewer is used in all treatment and control groups
* There is a positive linear relationship between response rates and the value of the incentive [Yu & Cooper (1983)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3151410.pdf).
* Giving an incentive is always better than no incentive because a monetary incentive is better than a non-monetary incentive [Singer et al (1999)](http://www.jos.nu/Articles/article.asp) and a non-monetary incentive is better than no incentive [Willimack et al (1995)](http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/1/78.short). 
* Our incentives have a such a value that they affect our respondents
* Their is no selection bias since we conducted the experiment on the same location and on the same day.
* People tend to be risk-averse and women are more risk-averse than men [Dohmen et al (2005)](http://ftp.iza.org/dp1730.pdf)
* A threshold of 0.05 is used in all our tests to indicate whether a difference or effect is significant
